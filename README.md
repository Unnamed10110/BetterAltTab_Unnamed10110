# BetterAltTab_Unnamed10110 v2

A modern, ultra-fast, and highly customizable Alt+Tab replacement for Windows, written in C++ with pure Win32 API. **Version 2** brings even more power-user features, robust tray integration, seamless virtual desktop support, and a beautiful, efficient overlay.

---

## üöÄ What's New in v2

- **Persistent Tray Icon**: The tray icon is always visible and auto-recovers after Explorer restarts or crashes.
- **Robust Alt+Q Navigation**: Open the overlay with Alt+Q, keep holding Alt, and use arrow keys to navigate. Release Alt to focus the selected window. Navigation only works while Alt is held, for a true power-user workflow.
- **Circular Navigation**: Arrow navigation wraps around‚Äîpressing right on the last window jumps to the first, and left on the first jumps to the last.
- **Efficient Overlay**: Uses a layered, double-buffered, rounded window with true transparency for smooth, flicker-free visuals and minimal CPU usage.
- **Virtual Desktop Awareness**: Instantly updates when you switch virtual desktops, always showing the correct windows.
- **Persistent Z-Order & Pinning**: Pin windows, reorder them, and your layout persists across sessions and even after Explorer crashes.
- **Quick Actions**: Close, pin, and move-to-position actions for each window, accessible via mouse or keyboard.
- **OLED Black Theme**: Overlay and popups use a true black background for perfect OLED displays.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Pure Win32 API, no Qt/.NET/third-party frameworks.
- **Super Fast**: Instant overlay, no lag, optimized for large numbers of windows.

## Demostration
```
# Quick commented guide:
- Press atl+q to open the overlay, with F2 you can change between dynamic mode and persistence z-order mode (you will notice the difference on the button 
right to the thumbnails)
- When cycling with alt+q, and you decide what window focus, just press again alt and it will focus that window (old behavior).
- Ctrl+Numpaddot has the same behavior as alt+tab (alt+q is an upgraded behavior)
```

- Dynamic Mode (Classic Mode)

- Z-order Persistence Mode:
-  You can pin multiple windows at the beginning and order then, also it mantains the z-order, independently from the process explorer.exe crashing or not.

- You can pin as many as you want, they always keep they position unless you changed, you can temrinate them, and give then a pinned gerarquy order:
- You also have the option to use shortcuts to acceso to the most importants windows pinned as important with jus the number in the window position
