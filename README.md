## üöÄ Features

## Demostration
```
# Quick commented guide:
- Press atl+q to open the overlay, with F2 you can change between dynamic mode and persistence z-order mode (you will notice the difference on the button right to the thumbnails)
- When cycling with alt+q, and you decide what window focus, just press again tab and it will focus that window.
- Ctrl+Numpaddot has the same behavior as alt+tab (alt+q is an upgraded behavior)
```

- Dynamic Mode (Classic Mode)

- Z-order Persistence Mode:
-  You can pin multiple windows at the beginning and order then, also it mantains the z-order, independently from the process explorer.exe crashing or not.

- You can pin as many as you want, they always keep they position unless you changed, you can temrinate them, and give then a pinned gerarquy order:
- You also have the option to use shortcuts to acceso to the most importants windows pinned as important with jus the number in the window position
